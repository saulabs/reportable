Reportable
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saulabs/reportable.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saulabs/reportable)

Reportable allows for the easy creation of reports based on `ActiveRecord` models.

Usage
-----

Usage is pretty easy. To declare a report on a model, simply define that the model provides a report:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base

      reportable :registrations, :aggregation => :count

    end

The `reportable` method takes a bunch more options which are described in the [API docs](http://rdoc.info/projects/saulabs/reportable). For example you could generate a report on
the number of updated users records per second or the number of registrations of users that have a last name that starts with `'A'` per month:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base

      reportable :last_name_starting_with_a_registrations, :aggregation => :count, :grouping => :month, :conditions => ["last_name LIKE 'A%'"]

      reportable :updated_per_second, :aggregation => :count, :grouping => :hour, :date_column => :updated_at

    end

For every declared report a method is generated on the model that returns the date:

    User.registrations_report

    User.last_name_starting_with_a_registrations_report

    User.updated_per_second_report


Working with the data
---------------------

The data is returned as an `Array` of `Array`s of `DateTime`s and `Float`s, e.g.:

    [
      [DateTime.now,          1.0],
      [DateTime.now - 1.day,  2.0],
      [DateTime.now - 2.days, 3.0]
    ]

Reportable provides helper methods to generate a sparkline image from this data that you can use in your views, e.g.:

    <%= google_report_tag(User.registrations_report) %>

For other options to generate sparklines see the [API docs](http://rdoc.info/projects/saulabs/reportable).


Installation
------------

To install the Reportable gem, simply run

    [sudo] gem install reportable

### Rails 3.x

To install Reportable for Rails 3.x, add it to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'reportable', :require => 'saulabs/reportable'

and generate the migration that create reportable's cache table (beware that reportable currently only supports ActiveRecord):

    rails generate reportable_migration

If you want to use reportable's JavaScript graph output format, you also have to generate the JavaScript files:

    rails generate reportable_raphael_assets

if you want to use [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/) or if you want to use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/):

		rails generate reportable_jquery_flot_assets


Plans
-----

* add support for Oracle and MSSQL
* add support for DataMapper
* add more options to generate graphs from the data
* add the option to generate textual reports on the command line
